# EBCM
My new command manager slightly inspired by EngineHub/Piston
# Purpose
The purpose of the EBCM is:
  * Fix some problems of my previous command manager
  * Allow things that weren't possible on the previous version
# Current State
While the command manager is working, it's not complete yet, there are a lot of features missing from the old command manager,
like the parametric commands, and still has some bugs that will be solved with the time. But, since it's relatively functional I released it
# TODO
- [ ] Fix the bug that's related to subcommands and optional arguments
- [ ] Develop the parametric commands
- [ ] Modify the parser so it's more maintainable and has better performance
- [ ] Refactor some things(command structure, implementations of interfaces) to make the above task easier to complete
- [ ] Create a bukkit and bungee wrappers
